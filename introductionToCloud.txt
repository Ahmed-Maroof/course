Cloud computing, also referred to as “the cloud” 

is the delivery of on-demand computing
resources—everything from applications to data centers—over the internet on a pay-for-use basis.
-------------------------------------------------
the US National Instituteof Standards and Technology (NIST’s) definition of cloud computing : 

cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources 
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
-------------------------------------------------

This cloud five essential characteristics, 

1- On-demand Self-service:
means that you get access to cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network you need, 
using a simple interface,without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

2- Broad Network Access:
means that cloud computing resources can be
accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones,
tablets, laptops, and workstations.

3- Resource Pooling:
is what gives cloud providers economies of
scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient.
Using a multi-tenant model, computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers; cloud
resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned, according to demand, without customers needing
to concern themselves with the physical location of these resources.

4- Rapid Elasticity :
implies that you can access more resources
when you need them, and scale back when you don’t—because resources are elastically
provisioned and released.

5- Measured Service:
means that you only pay for what you use or
reserve as you go; if you’re not using resources, you’re not paying.
Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization.

--------------------------------------------------------

cloud deployment models: 

1- Public cloud : is when you leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by
the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies.

2- Private cloud : means that the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single
organization.It could run on-premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.

3- Hybrid model: And when you use a mix of both public and private clouds, working together seamlessly,

--------------------------------------------------------
cloud service models :  Infra - platform - application 



1- IAAS "Infrastructure as a Service model", you get access to infrastructure and physical computing resources 
such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space without the need to manage or operate them.

2- PAAS a Platform as a Service model, you get access to the platform, that is the hardwareand software tools,
 usually those needed to develop and deploy applications to users over the Internet.

3- SAAS Software as a Service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications
are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis, and sometimes also referred to as 
"on-demand software."

Module 1 : vid 2 

Cloud computing is an evolution of technology over time.

1950s :  when large-scale mainframes with high-volume processing power became available
In order to make efficient use of the computing power of mainframes, 
the practice of time sharing, or resource pooling, evolved Using dumb terminals

1970s: , with the release of an operating system called Virtual Machine or VM,
 it became possible for mainframes to have multiple virtual systems, 
 or virtual machines, on a single physical node.

Each virtual machine hosted guest operating systems that behaved as though they had their own memory, CPU, and hard drives, even though 
these were shared resources. 

-----------------------------------------------------

servers were virtualized into shared hosting environments
- virtual private servers, and
- virtual dedicated servers, 
using the same types of functionality provided by the virtual machine operating system.

so, for example, if a company needed ‘x’ number of physical systems to run their applications,
they could take one physical node and split it into multiple virtual systems.
This was enabled by hypervisors.

-----------------------------------------------------

-hypervisor : 

is a small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside each other,
sharing the same physical computing resources. A hypervisor also separates the Virtual Machines logically, 
assigning each its own slice of the underlying computing power, memory, and storage,
 preventing the virtual machines from interfering with each other.

------------------------------------------------------
As technologies and hypervisors improved and were able to share and deliver resources reliably,
بعض الشركات استغلت الوضع وبدأت تقسم في المبود بتاعها عشان تأجره


Users could now order cloud resources they needed from a larger pool of available resources
and they could pay for them on a per-use basis, also known as Pay-As-You-Go.
------------------------------------------------------

- pay-as-you-go :

1- utility computing model, became one of the key drivers behind cloud computing taking off,

2- The pay-per-use model allowed companies and even individual developers to pay for the computing resources as and when they used them,

3- This allowed them to switch to a more cash-flow friendly OpEx model from a CapEx model.

4- This model appealed to all sizes of companies, those who had little or no hardware, and even those that had lots of hardware, 
  because now, instead of making huge capital expendituresin hardware, they could pay for compute resources as and when needed.

5- It also allowed them to scale their workloads during usage peaks, and scale down when usagesubsided.


And this gave rise to modern-day cloud computing.

cloud adoption strategy 

"Agility, flexibility, and competitiveness" 
are key drivers for moving to the cloud, provided it is done without creating business disruption or issues related to security,
 compliance and performance.
-----------------------------------------------

considerations : اللي الشركات محتاجاها وهي بتتحول للكلود

1- infrastructure and workloads.

The cost of building and operating data centers can become astronomical.
On the other hand, low initial costs and pay-as-you-go attributes of cloud computing can add up to
significant cost savings.


2- SaaS and development platforms 

not all workloads may be ready for the cloud, as isSaaS and development platforms cloud be best fit for them .
Organizations need to consider if paying for application access is a more viable option than purchasing off-the-shelf software 
and subsequently investing in upgrades.


3- speed and productivity, what it means for them
to get a new application up and running in ‘x’ hours on the cloud versus a couple of weeks, even months on traditional platforms.
And the person-hour cost efficiencies they gain from using cloud dashboards, real-time statistics, and active analytics.


4- impact of making a wrong decision, 
their risk exposure. Is it riskier, for example, for them to invest in the hardware and software or rent by the hour?
Is it safer for them to work on a 12-month plan to build, write, test, and release the code if they’re uncertain about adoption?
And is it better for them to “try” something new paying-as-you-go rather than making long-term decisions based on little or no trial or adoption?

-----------------------------------------------------------------


benefits of cloud adoption: 

categorized broadly into Flexibility, Efficiency, and Strategic Value.

1-flexibility.

- Users can scale back or scale up services to fit their needs, customize applications, and access cloud services 
  from anywhere with an internet connection.

- Cloud infrastructure scales on demand to support fluctuating workloads.
- Organizations can determine their level of control with as-a-service options.
- Users can select from a menu of pre-built tools and features to build a solution that fits their specific needs.
- Virtual Private Clouds, encryption, and API keys help keep data secure.


2- efficiency.

- Enterprise users can get applications to market quickly without worrying about underlying infrastructure costs or its maintenance.
- Cloud-based applications and data are accessible from virtually any internet-connected device.
- Hardware failures do not result in data loss because of networked backups.
- Cloud computing uses remote resources, saving organizations the cost of servers and other equipment, and paying on use-basis.
- Cloud services give enterprises a competitive advantage by providing the most innovative
   technologies available while managing the underlying infrastructure, thus enabling organizations to focus on their priorities.

------------------------------------------------------------
 cloud challenges: 

1- Data security, associated with loss or unavailability of data causing business disruption
2- Governance and sovereignty issues
3- Legal, regulatory, and compliance issues
4- Lack of standardization in how the constantly evolving technologies integrate and interoperate;
5- Choosing the right deployment and service models to serve specific needs;
6- Partnering with the right cloud service providers;
7- Concerns related to business continuity and disaster recovery.

module 2 : vid 3 Internet of Things in the Cloud (4:07)

- IoT powered by cloud 
    - is making a big difference for businesses today. 
    -is a giant network of connected things and people that have changed much of how we live our daily lives ,
     from the way we drive, to how we make purchases,monitoring our personal health, and even how we get energy for our homes.

-Smart devices and sensors are continuously tracking and collecting data.

For example,
- smart building could have thousands of sensors measuring all kinds of data related to thermal, optical, structural, and environmental stimuli. 
An unprecedented amount of data is being generated, putting a tremendous strain on the Internet.
That is where the cloud comes in, by connecting the IoT device user to the cloud - 
be it for 
device registration,
device identity,
storing data, 
accessing enterprise data. 

- Data collected through IoT devices is stored and processed on the cloud 
  since IoT devices can be in a state of motion.

-the cloud serves as a collection point in closest proximity, minimizing the latency in reporting up the data points 
and providing a response back to the IoT application.

So, 
from "IOT platforms" running entirely on the cloud 
to the "interface" used by customers 
to interact these devices, 
to the backend analyticsplatforms 

- cloud computing supports and enables IoT. Cloud service providers also offer 
    "specialized IoT services" designed to help speed up the development of IoT solutions.
    
-case study
    that demonstrates the use of the IoT on the cloud to combat the poaching of endangered rhinos at Welgevonden by making poaching predictable.

    The rhinos have become one of the the key species that is becoming endangered due to poaching throughout Africa. 
    But now especially in South Africa. Up until now, poachers have been increasing in numbers, 
    and they become more militarized with weapons. And so of course we've had to do the same. 
    This is not sustainable. The only way to do this better, is to bring in technology and things that they do not have.
    This endangered species is getting help from some unexpected friends, the zebra and antelope. They're wearing IoT sensors
    connected to the IBM cloud. When poachers enter the area, the animals run for it,
    which alerts Rangers who can track their emotions and help stop them before any harm is done.

    It's a smart way to help increase the Rhino population and turn the poachers into the endangered species. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 2 : vid 3 Artificial Intelligence on the Cloud (3:35)

- AI : Making sense of the endless streams of data 
-Many of the applications where we apply AI today simply wouldn't have been possible without the scalable, on-demand computing offered by the cloud.

- There is a three-way relationship between AI +  IoT, + Cloud.
    - AI consumes the data produced by IoT devices
    - the IoT devices’ behavior can be dictated based on responses from AI.

For example,
Smart Assistants: 
    a common type of IoT device, continues to learn about the user’s preferences as usage grows,
    such as 
     - the songs they like, 
     - their home temperature settings,
     - preferred meal times,
     - and over time they anticipate their actions based on the user’s past history.


 - symbiotic علاقه تكافليه relationship between IoT, AI, and Cloud.
    - IoT delivers the data, 
    - AI powers the insights,
    - and both these emerging technologies leverage cloud’s scalability 
        and processing power to provide value to individuals and businesses alike.

- Case study:   
     United States Tennis Association, USTA "using AI on the Cloud"

    - to deliver unique digital experiences to millions of fans around the world.
    - IBM integrates and analyzes the data flowing from the court.
        And delivers unique digital experiences to more than ten million tennis fans around the world.
        And we do it all in the IBM Cloud.

    - The IBM Cloud is the digital foundation of the US Open.
        1- It scales rapidly to meet a five thousand percent increase in web traffic.
        2- And it delivers a consistant experience to our fans all around the globe.
        3- And with Watson on the IBM Cloud, we can engage fans in unique ways, year after year.

    "Slam Tracker" :
     - analyzes more than twenty-six million historical data points.
     - It gives fans deep insight into featured matches, 
     - and it can see the momentum of a match shifting in real time.
     - AI Highlights uses Watson to process thousands of hours of US Open video.
     - It can hear the cheers of the crowd.
     - It can see a player celebrating.
     - And it knows what makes a great tennis highlight.

    "Watson" is analyzing match video,
        1- so coaches can quickly find the footage they need to guide the development of their players.
        2- And if you need to know where to park, 
            find a good burger, 
            or grab the latest US Open gear,

Module 2 : vid 4 Blockchain and Analytics on the Cloud (5:35)

Blockchain: 
 - is a secure, distributed, open technology that can help 
    speed up processes, 
    lower costs, 
    and build transparency and traceability in transactional applications.
 
 - It is an "immutable Network" allowing members to view only those transactions that are relevant to them.
    The more open, diverse, and distributed the network,
    the stronger the trust and transparency in the data and transactions.
  
- 85% of businesses today rely on multiple clouds to meet their IT needs, And more than 70% using more than three.  
    These businesses need to be able to move applications and data across multiple clouds easily and securely,
    leading to the emerging demand to build and manage business applications such as blockchain for the multi cloud environment.
    
- Blockchain and AI, much like IoT and AI, powered by the cloud, زيهم زي العلاقه اللي فاتت 
     also have a three-way relationship. Where
    - blockchain technology provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth,
    - AI powers the analytics and decision-making from the data collected,
    - and cloud provides globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources
        to support both the unprecedented amounts of data being collected and the processing power required to draw insights from this data.
        
-Blockchain serves to make AI more understandable 
    by recording the data and variables that go into a decision made in an AI algorithm,
    leading to greater trust and transparency in the conclusions and decisions made by these algorithms.
    
Case Study : 
"blockchain on the cloud is helping farmers reduce waste at times"

- recall by building traceability and transparency in the food supply chain.
    - 60% of the nation's lettuce is grown in Salinas. When it comes down to how plants are looked at, I
        really relate back to how humans are raised and nurtured.
    - With Blockchain technology on the IBM cloud , we're able to track our product within seconds. 
        - Giving the consumers instant
        - access where the product came from,
        - in case there's any recall so we don't have to take all the food off the shelves.
        - reduce the waste. There's a lot of


Analytics technologies : 

 - leverage  تقوي the flexibility, scalability, and computing resources available on the cloud. 
    - From tracking trends on social media 
    - to predict future events, 
    - to analyzing data to build machine learning models that can be deployed in cognitive applications,
     
 cloud provides the integrated environment that is required to leverage data for continuous improvement and 
    accelerated business growth. 


- Case Study: 
  - "KONE" :   بتوع المصاعد اللي بيجمعوا داتا
        invested in cloud and IoT technologies to power a data analytics and predictive maintenance solution for city infrastructure used 
        by more than 1 billion people daily. 
        
 - At KONE we manufacture elevators, escalators, auto walks, and doors All of these devices are streams of data that we are collecting.
    In order to process those streams, we need a scalable way of handling the amount of data that is coming in.
     And that's where cloud function fits in perfectly.

- They handle that data with event-driven architecture. 
    - We use functions to persist that data, 
        and to generate further events on that data, 
        that are then utilized and consumed by applications - customers - users.

 In our analytics platform, 
 - we analyzed the set of data 
 - and we generate value predictive in a sense that we can predict the failure rate to a certain percentage that is 
    about to happen in the future for our equipment
     And this allows us to perform predictive maintenance. 
    
    And this is kind of the whole concept that we have behind our 24/7 connected services,
    which is a promise to our customers. That the equipment is connected to the cloud and we are monitoring it. 
    And that's where we generate the real a value for our customers. At the moment we use almost all aspects of the IBM cloud.
    - We use storage from the cloud.
    - We use cloud function.
    - We use messaging services. 
    -We use IoT services.

Module 3 - Cloud Computing Service and Deployment Models 
Module 3 - vid 1 Overview of Service Models (4:18)


IaaS : 
  - is a set of compute networking and storage resources that have been virtualized by a vendor so that 
    a user can access and configure them any way they want. 

IaaS personas :
    - is a system admin, or an IT admin.
    

SaaS :  
 - software that you don't have to install on your machine and you don't have to manually update.
    And so the user for Software as a Service could be anyone. In fact, if you're
    watching this on YouTube right now, then you're a user of Software as a Service.

 - It's usually charged on a subscription model rather than a one-time license fee.


PaaS : 
 -takes advantage of all the virtualized resources from Iaas and then just abstracts them away,
  so the user doesn't have to worry about managing any of those virtualized resources.
 
 -"Persona" The user for PaaS is not a system admin, usually. It's usually a dev.


- is meant to indicate that as you move down, you're increasing complexity in
terms of your knowledge and management of infrastructure resources.
- pyramid 
    - SaaS
    - PaaS
    - IaaS

- So let's see what it means in terms of cloud
computing and its three service models with 

- IaaS 
    the cloud provider manages the physical resources, 
                                        data centers, 
                                        cooling 
                                        power,

                                        and security, 
                                        as well as computing resources that include servers and storage.


 - PaaS

Module 3 VID 2 IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service (4:18) 


- Infrastructure-as-a-Service “IaaS” 
     is a form of cloud computing that delivers 
                                        fundamental compute,
                                        network, 
                                        and storage resources 
    to consumers 
                on-demand, 
                over the internet, 
                on a pay-as-you-go basis.

- The cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components "traditionally present in an on-premises data center" 
                          as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.

- In an IaaS Cloud environment, 
    1- customers can create or provision virtual machines (or VMs)
        in their choice of Region and Zone available from the Cloud Provider.

    2- These VMs typically come pre-installed the customer’s choice of operating system.

    3- The customers can then deploy middleware, install applications, and run workloads on these VMs.
    
    4- They can also and create storage for their workloads and backups.

    5- Cloud providers often provide customers the ability to 
        track and monitor the performance
        and usage of their cloud services 
        and manage disaster recovery.


-key components of cloud infrastructure:

    1-Physical data centers: IaaS providers manage large data centers that contain the physical
                             machines required to power the various layers of abstraction on top of them.

                            In most IaaS models, end users do not interact directly with the physical infrastructure
                            but experience it as a service provided to them.

    2-Compute: 
        - providers manage the hypervisors 
        - and end-users programmatically provision virtual instances 
            with desired amounts of 
            compute, 
            memory, 
            and storage resources.

        - Cloud compute typically comes with supporting services 
            like auto scaling 
            and load balancing
            that provide scalability and 
                         high performance.

    3-Network: 
        Users get access to networking resources on the cloud through virtualization or programmatically through APIs.


    4-Storage: 
        There are three types of cloud data storage: 
            object, 
            file,
            block storage.

        - Object storage 
                is the most common mode of storage in the cloud, given that it is highly distributed and resilient.


- IaaS use cases.

    1- Organizations today are using cloud infrastructure services 
        to enable their teams 
                            - to set up test and development environments faster,
                            - helping create new applications more quickly.

        By abstracting the low-level components, 
        
     - cloud infrastructure is helping developers focus more on business logic than infrastructure management.

 2- Business continuity and disaster recovery 
        - require a significant amount of technology and staff investments.
        - IaaS is helping organizations reduce this cost and make applications and data accessible
         as usual during a disaster or outage.

 3- deploy their web applications faster and
    - also scale infrastructure up and down as demand fluctuates.

4- leveraging the high-performance computing capabilities of cloud infrastructure
    to solve complex problems involving millions of variables and calculations, 
        such as 
            -climate and weather predictions and financial modeling.
            -Mining massive data sets to locate valuable patterns,
                - trends, 
                - and associations requires a huge amount of processing power.

 - Cloud infrastructure not only provides the required high-performance computing but also makes it economically viable.

- While there are some concerns
    -regarding the lack of transparency in the cloud infrastructure’s configuration 
    - and management and dependency on a third-party for workload availability performance 
    
    
-Infrastructure-as-a-Service is the fastest growing cloud model today.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 3 VID 3 PaaS Platform as a Service (6:47)

-“PaaS” :
is a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure to 
develop,deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third-party.

- The PaaS provider :
    - hosts everything { servers, networks, storage, operating system, application runtimes, APIs, middleware, databases, and other tools—at their data center }.
    - takes responsibility for the installation, 
                                   configuration,
                                   operation of the application infrastructure
                                leaving the user responsible for only the application "code" and its "maintenance".

- Customers:
 pay for this service on a "usage basis" and purchase resources "on-demand".

 - قارن بينها وبين اللي قبلها

    - IaaS: 
        the cloud provider offers access to "raw" computing resources, such as
            servers, storage, and networking, 
        while the user is responsible for the platform and application software.

    - PaaS: 
         the cloud service provider delivers and manages the entire platform infrastructure, abstracting users from the lower-level details of the environment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- essential characteristics of Platform-as-a-Service:

PaaS clouds are distinguished تتميز by 

1-the high level of abstraction they provide to the users:
    - eliminating the complexity of deploying applications, 
                                    configuring infrastructure, 
                                    and provisioning, configuring supporting technologies like 
                                                                                load balancers and databases.

2- PaaS clouds provide "services and APIs" :
    -that help simplify the job of developers in delivering elastically scalable and highly available cloud applications.
    -  such as APIs for distributed caching, 
                        queuing and messaging, 
                        file and data storage, 
                        workload management,
                         user identity,
                         and analytics,
       
    thus eliminating the need to integrate disparate components.


3 The PaaS runtime :
 
    - executes end-user code according to policies set by the "application owner" and "cloud provider".
    - Many of the PaaS offerings provide developers with 
        rapid deployment mechanisms, or “push and run” mechanism, for deploying and running applications.

4 application infrastructure : (or middleware) capabilities,
        such as application servers, 
                database management systems, 
                business analytics services, 
                mobile back-end services,
                integration services, 
                business process management systems, 
                rules engines,
                complex event processing systems.

Such an application infrastructure assists developers by reducing the amount of code that must be written while expanding the application’s functional capabilities.

The most important use case : 
 - strategic—build, test, deploy, enhance, and scale applications rapidly and cost-effectively.


Let’s look at some more use cases for PaaS:

 1- API development and management:
    Organizations are using PaaS to develop, run, manage, and secure APIs and microservices, 
    which are loosely coupled, independently deployable components and services.

 2-Internet of Things, or IoT: 
    PaaS clouds support a broad range of application environments, programming languages, and tools used for IoT deployments.

3- Business analytics/intelligence: 
    PaaS tools allow organizations to analyze their data to find business insights that enable more informed business decisions and predictions.

4- Business Process Management, or BPM: 
Organizations are using the PaaS cloud to access BPM platform delivered as a service. 

5- Master data management, or MDM: 
Organizations are leveraging the PaaS cloud to provide a single point of reference for critical business data such as information about customer transactions
and analytical data to support decision making.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advantages of using PaaS: 

1- Scalability: 
made possible because of the rapid allocation and deallocation of resources 
    with a pay-as-you-use model offered by PaaS.


2-The APIs: 
 - support services, and middleware capabilities that PaaS clouds provide assist developers in focusing their efforts 
    on application development and testing, resulting in faster time to market for their products and services.

 - Middleware capabilities also reduce the amount of code that needs to be written while expanding
    the application’s functional capabilities.

3- Greater agility and innovation : 
    -because using PaaS platforms means that you can experiment with multiple 
     operating systems, languages, and tools without having to invest in these resources.

    - You can evaluate and prototype ideas with very low risk exposure resulting in faster,
            easier, less-risky adoption of a wider range of resources.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key PaaS offerings available : 
1- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
2- Cloud Foundry on IBM Cloud
3- IBM Cloud Paks
4- Windows Azure
5- RedHat OpenShift
6- Magento Commerce Cloud
7- Force.com 
8- Apache Stratos.

--------------------------------------------
PaaS clouds risks:
 "عيوب الكلود العامه زي"  
1- information security: threats and dependency on the service provider infrastructure.      
2- ervice provider infrastructure experiences downtime: Services can get impacted. 
3- user don't have direct control: over the changes that may take place when a provider makes changes in its strategy, service offerings, or tools.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 3 Vid 4  SaaS - Software as a Service (4:47)

- SaaS : 
     is a cloud offering that provides users with access to a service provider cloud-based software.

    - SaaS providers maintain 
                            the servers, 
                            databases, 
                            and code that constitute an application.

    - They also manage access to the application, including 
                                    security, 
                                    availability, 
                                    performance.
    - Applications reside on a remote cloud network, and users use these applications without having
        to maintain and update the infrastructure.

- ex: business processes supported by SaaS today 

    1- email: and collaboration via offerings such as 
            Microsoft's Office 365 and Google's Gmail.

    2- CRM: Customer Relationship Management via services such as 
        NetSuite CRM and Salesforce,

    3- HCM: Human Resource Management via services from 
        Workday and SAP SuccessFactors,

    4- financial management: billing and collaboration, and many more.

According to Forrester Research:

 SaaS has overtaken on-premises solutions in categories such as 
 human capital management (HCM),
  customer relationship management (CRM), 
  and collaboration.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
key characteristics of Software-as-a-Service: 

1- multitenant architecture: 
    - Infrastructure and code are maintained centrally and accessed by all users.
    - SaaS makes it easy for users to manage privileges, 
                                     monitor data use, 
                                    ensure everyone sees the same information at the same time.

2- Security: 
    compliance, and maintenance are all part of the offering.

   - Users can customize applications to fit their business processes with point-and-click ease.
   - Users can customize the UI to work with their branding guidelines; 
            - modify data fields
            - enable or disable features within the business process.
        These customizations are preserved through upgrades.


3- subscription model : 
    Users pay for the use of the services via a subscription model. 
            The use of resources can be scaled easily, depending on service needs.

---------------------------------------------------------------            
Key benefits of adopting SaaS: 

1- Businesses can directly procure solutions :
        without upfront capital and assistance from IT, greatly reducing the time from decision to value from months to days.

2- increases workforce productivity and efficiency:
        - Users can access core business apps from wherever they
        - they can also buy and deploy apps in minutes
             reducing the typical obstacles enterprises have to to test the products they they might use.

3- individuals and small enterprises can spread out their software costs over time:

-----------------------------------------------------------

use cases for SaaS: 

1- educe on-premises IT infrastructure : Organizations are moving to SaaS for their core business needs
 as part of their strategic transformation to reduce on-premises IT infrastructure 
                                              reduce capital expenditure.

2-  avoid the need for ongoing upgrades : Oragnzaitions are leveraging SaaS to 
    avoid the need for ongoing upgrades, maintenance, and patching,
         done traditionally by internal IT resources; applications run reliably with minimal input,
    for example: email servers and office collaboration and productivity tools.

3-eCommerce Platforms : Organizations are increasingly opting for SaaS eCommerce Platforms 
to manage their websites,marketing, sales, and operations.

4- resilience and business continuity: With SaaS, organizations are able to 
    take advantage of the resilience and business continuity of the cloud provider
-----------------------------------------------------

SaaS integration platforms (or SIPs) : 

Enterprises are now developing them  for building additional SaaS applications,
 moving SaaS beyond standalone software functionality to a platform for mission-critical applications.


SaaS concerns: 
1- data ownership and data safety.
2- Security is an important consideration when you’re allowing a third-party to maintain business-critical data.
3- application access relies on a good internet connection—if you’re not connected, you cannot access the apps.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 3 vid 5 : Public Cloud (5:33) 

Deployment models : indicate where the infrastructure resides, 
                             who owns and manages it
                             how cloud resources and services are made available to users.


public cloud model:
 - users get access to servers, storage, network, security, and applications as services
    delivered by cloud service providers over the internet.
- Using web consoles and APIs,
- users can provision the resources and services they need.
- The cloud provider owns
                     manages
                     provisions
                     maintains the infrastructure,
                     renting it out to customers either for a subscription charge 
                                                            OR usage-based fee.

- Users don’t own the servers their applications run on
                 or storage their data consumes,
                 or manage the operations of the servers
                 or even determine how the platforms are maintained.


 - Public clouds offer significant cost savings as the provider bears all the capital, operational, and maintenance expenses
             for the infrastructure and the facilities they are hosted in.

- It makes scalability as easy as requesting more capacity.

- public cloud providers : 
 1- Amazon Web Services,
 2- Microsoft Azure
 3- IBM Cloud
 4- Google Cloud Platform
 5- and Alibaba Cloud.
While all providers include a common set of core services, 
such as servers, storage, network, security, and databases
 they also offer a wide spectrum of niche services with varied payment options.

characteristics of a public cloud:

A public cloud : 1- is a virtualized multi-tenant architecture enabling "tenants" or "users" to
                    share computing resources, residing outside their firewalls.

2-- The cloud providers pool of resources, including 
                infrastructure, 
                platforms, 
                software
    are NOT dedicated for use by a single tenant or organization.

 3- Resources are distributed on an as-needed basis offered through a variety of subscription and pay-as-you-go models.


Public clouds benefits: 
1-  fast on-demand resources are available : allowing applications to respond seamlessly to fluctuations in demand. لو احتاج يزود ريسورسس يزودخا بسهوله

2- the most significant economies of scale: Considering the large number of users that share the centralized cloud resources on-demand,
        he public cloud offers the most significant economies of scale.

3-highly reliable : the sheer number of server and network resources available on the public cloud means that a
                     public cloud is highly reliable—if one physical component fails, the service still runs unaffected
                    on the remaining available components.

public clouds concerns : 

1- security and data sovereignty compliance.
        Security issues such as data breaches, data loss, account hijacking, insufficient due
        diligence, and system and application vulnerability seem to be some of the fears users continue
        to have concerning security in the public cloud.
        
2- data being stored in different locations and accessed across "national borders", it has
    also become increasingly critical for companies to be compliant with 
    data sovereignty regulations
    governing the storage,
    transfer, and security of data.


use cases for public cloud:
1- teams can focus on building and testing applications :
     Organizations are increasingly opting to access cloud-based applications and platforms so
     their teams can focus on building and testing applications, and reducing time-to-market
    for their products and services.

2- Businesses with fluctuating: متقلب capacity and resourcing needs are opting for the public cloud.

3- build secondary infrastructures: 
    Organizations are using public cloud computing resources to build secondary infrastructures
    for disaster recovery, data protection, and business continuity.

4- greater accessibility : 
    organizations are using cloud storage and data management services for greater
                accessibility, easy distribution, and backing up their data.


5-outsourcing the management :
 IT departments are outsourcing the management of less critical and standardized business
    platforms and applications to pubic cloud providers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Module 3 Video 6 : Private Cloud (4:54)

- The National Institute of Standards and Technology "NIST" : 
    defines Private Cloud : 
        as cloud infrastructure provisioned for "exclusive" use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers ده لو الاورجانيزاشن عندها اكتر من انتتي جواها ,
        such as the business units within the organization.

    - It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises

- Private cloud platforms can be implemented internally or externally.

Internally : 

     When the platform is provisioned over an organization’s internal infrastructure, it runs on-premises
    and is owned, managed, and operated by the "organization".

externally:   
    
    When it is provisioned over a cloud provider’s infrastructure, it is owned, managed, and
    operated by the service provider.

 - vpc :
     external private cloud offering that resides on a cloud service provider’s infrastructure is called a Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC.

    -  is a public cloud offering that lets an organization establish its
             own private and secure cloud-like computing environment in a "logically isolated part" of a shared public cloud.

Using a VPC : 
1-  organizations can leverage 
                             1- dynamic scalability
                             2- high availability,
                             3- lower cost of ownership of a public cloud التي تتميز بيها الببليك كلاود 
                             4- having the infrastructure and security tailored to the organization’s unique needs.

2-  VPC are offered by most Public Cloud providers such as IBM and Amazon.

-------------------------------------------------------------
A private cloud : 

     is a virtualized environment modeled to bring in the benefits of a public cloud platform 
        without the perceived disadvantages of an open and shared public platform.

 - Users of a private cloud, such as Developers and Business Units in an organization, still
    get to leverage benefits such as e
                 conomies of scale, 
                 granular scale, 
                 operational efficiencies,

- and user self-service, while exercising 
            full control over access, security, and compliances specific to their organization and business.

- Private clouds provide you with The ability to 
    leverage the value of cloud computing using systems 
    that are directly managed or under perceived control of the organization’s internal IT.


- The ability to better utilize internal computing resources,
     such as the organization’s existing investments in hardware and software, thereby reducing costs.
        - Better scalability through virtualization and “cloud bursting,” i.e., 
        
- leveraging public cloud instances for a period of time but returning to the private cloud when the surge is met.

- Controlled access and greater security measures customized to specific organizational needs.

- The ability to expand and provision things in a relatively short amount of time, providing greater agility.

Organizations may choose to opt for private cloud because of various reasons—because
their applications provide a unique competitive advantage,
 1- there are security and regulatory concerns, 
 2- because the data is highly sensitive and subject to strict industry or governmental regulations.


use cases for a private cloud:

1- modernize and unify their in-house: 
A private cloud is an opportunity for organizations to modernize and unify their in-house and legacy applications.

2- leverage the power of the compute resources on the cloud : 
    Moving these applications from their dedicated hardware to the cloud also allows them to
        leverage the power of the compute resources and multiple services available on the cloud.

3- integrating WITH PUBLIC CLOUD : 
    Using the private cloud, organizations are integrating data and application services
    from their existing applications with public cloud services.

4- Application portability : 
is a key feature of cloud platforms. Using the private cloud gives organizations the flexibility to build applications anywhere,
and move them anywhere, without having to compromise security and compliance in the process.
--------------------------------------------------------------


prevent an organization from moving to a public cloud
1 - include security and regulatory concerns
2-  and data sensitivity.

 SO A private cloud offers these organizations the benefits of
   on-demand enterprise resources while exercising full control over critical security and compliance issues from within
the environment of their dedicated cloud.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 3 Video 7 : Hybrid Cloud (5:59)

Hybrid cloud :
    is a computing environment that connects an organization’s on-premise private cloud and third-party public cloud 
        into a single, flexible infrastructure for running the organization’s applications and workloads.
         
 - The mix of public and private cloud resources gives organizations the flexibility to choose
        the optimal cloud for each application or workload. Workloads move freely between the two clouds as needs change.

- Organizations can choose to run the
                 sensitive, highly-regulated, and mission-critical applications
                or workloads with 
                reasonably constant performance and capacity requirements on "private cloud"infrastructure 
                
    while deploying the 
           less-sensitive and more-dynamic workloads on the public cloud.

With proper integration and orchestration between the public and private clouds, 
you can leverage both clouds for the same workload.

For example:
 cloud bursting:  you can leverage additional public cloud capacity to accommodate a spike in demand for a private cloud application (also known as “cloud bursting”).

The key tenets of a hybrid cloud are 
    interoperability, التوافقيه
     scalability, 
     and portability.

 - key tenets  مبادئ:     

1-interoperable: which means that the public and private cloud services can understand each other’s APIs,
         configuration,
         data formats, 
         and forms of authentication
        and authorization.

2- Scalable:  When there is a spike in demand, a workload running on the private cloud can leverage the additional public cloud capacity, making it scalable.

3-portable: —since you’re no longer locked-in with a specific vendor, you can move applications and data not just between on-premise and cloud systems, but
also between cloud service providers. Hybrid is about taking the best of both worlds.


types of hybrid clouds: 

1- hybrid monocloud : 
    is a hybrid cloud with one cloud provider, 
    while a hybrid multicloud is an open standards-based stack that can be deployed on any public cloud infrastructure.

2 - hyprid multicloud: "flexibility"
    The difference lies in the flexibility that the hybrid multicloud offers organizations to move workloads and environments from one vendor to another.


 - There is also a variant of hybrid multicloud called the "composite multicloud",  
 composite multicloud:  
    which makes this flexibility even more granular محبب  as it distributes single applications across multiple providers,
     allowing you to move application components across cloud services and vendors as needed.


- Hybrid cloud offers significant benefits: in areas of
    security and compliance,
    scalability
    resilience,
    resource optimization 
    cost-saving.


A hybrid cloud 
- lets organizations deploy highly regulated or sensitive workloads in a privatecloud 
while running the less-sensitive workloads on a public cloud.

- you can scale up quickly, inexpensively, and even automatically using the public cloud infrastructure,
 all without impacting the other workloads running on your private cloud.

- Because you’re not locked-in with a specific vendor
    and also don’t have to make either-or decisions between the different cloud models,
    you can make the most cost-efficient use of your infrastructure budget.

- You can maintain workloads where they are most efficient, spin-up environments using pay-as-you-go in the public cloud, 
    and rapidly adopt new tools as you need them.

- A typical organization will have a range of applications and workloads spread across private, public, and traditional IT environments.
This represents a range of opportunities for optimization via a hybrid cloud approach.

hybrid cloud use cases:
 1- Software-as-a-Service integration:

        Through hybrid integration, organizations are connecting Software-as-a-Service applications
        available in the public cloud to their existing public cloud, private cloud, and traditional
        IT applications to deliver new solutions.

 2-Data and AI integration:
        Organizations today are creating richer and more personal experiences by combining new
        data sources on the public cloud—such as 
            weather, 
            social, 
            the Internet of Things, 
            CRM,
            ERP

        with existing data and analytics,
                              machine learning, 
                            and AI capabilities.

    Enhancing legacy apps.

3-modernizing their core business systems :
 An increasing number of organizations  are using public cloud services to upgrade the user experience of their on-premises applications
     and deploy them globally to new devices, while incrementally modernizing their core business systems.
4- VMware migration "lifting and shifting":

    - More and more organizations are “lifting and shifting” their on-premises virtualized workloads 
            to a public cloud without 
            conversion or modification 
        to reduce their on-premises data center footprint and position themselves to scale without added capital expense

Module 4 - Components of Cloud Computing 
Module 4 vid1 Overview of Cloud Infrastructure (6:30) 


- The infrastructure layer is the foundation of the cloud: 

    - This layer consists of physical resources that are housed in Regions, Zones and Data Centers.
    - A Cloud provider’s IT environment is typically distributed across many Regions around the world.

A cloud Region:
     -is a geographic area or location where a Cloud provider’s infrastructure is clustered, and may have names like "NA South" or "US East".
     -The cloud Regions are isolated from each other so that if one Region was impacted by a natural disaster like an Earthquake, the Cloud operations in other Regions would keep running.

    Each Cloud Region can have multiple Zones (or Availability Zones or AZ for short), 

Availability Zones : 
    1- which are typically distinct Data Centers with their own power, cooling and networking resources.
    2-These Zones can have names like "DAL-09" or "us-east-1".

    3- The isolation of zones improves the cloud’s overall fault tolerance, decreases latency, and avoids creating a single shared point of failure.
    4-The Availability Zones (and DataCenters within them) are connected to other AZs and regions,private datacenters and the Internet using very high bandwidth network connectivity.

A cloud Data center :

 - is a huge room or a warehouse containing cloud infrastructure.
 - These data centers contain "pods" and "racks" or standardized containers of computing resources such as 
    servers, storage,  networking equipment , virtually everything that a physical IT environment has.

Computing Resources: 
Cloud providers offer several compute options
  - Virtual Servers,
  - Bare Metal Servers, 
  - “Serverless” computing resources.

 - Most of the servers in a cloud datacenter run hypervisors to create virtual servers or virtual machines (also called VMs for short),
     that are software-based computers, based on virtualization technologies.

 - Other servers in the racks are bare metal servers that are physical servers that aren’t virtualized.

 - Customers can provision VMs and Bare Metals servers as and when they need them and run their workloads on them.

Cloud users can also run their workloads on serverless computing resources, 

serverless computing resources : which are an abstraction layer on top of virtual machines

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Storage: 
 -Information and data can consist of files, code, documents, images, videos, backups, snapshots, and databases and can be stored
    in many different types of storage options on the Cloud.

- Bare Metal Servers and Virtual Servers are provisioned with default storage in local drives. بيجي معاهم ديفولت ستورج بس بتروح الداتا اللي فيها لو انت سبت الريسورس 
-Since these cloud servers can be provisioned and decommissioned by customers on demand and 
    freed up for use by other users, any information stored in a local drive can be lost when you delete or decommission a cloud server.

- However there are other storage options available on the cloud to persist data that you can choose depending on factors like 
    - how important your data is?
    - how quickly you want to be able to access it?
    - how often you access it?
    - how secure you need it to be ?


- These additional storage options include 
    Block storage
    File storage
    Object storage.

-Block and file storage : 
     are commonly used in traditional data centers
                 struggle with scale
                 performance and distributed characteristics of cloud

- Object storage : is the most common mode of storage in the cloud as it’s both highly distributed and resilient.
----------------------------------------------------
Networking: 
    Networking infrastructure in a cloud datacenter
        - includes traditional networking hardware like routers and switches, but more importantly for users of the Cloud,
        
        -the Cloud providers have Software Defined Networking (or SDN) : 
          - where certain networking resources are virtualized or made available programmatically, through APIs.
          - This allows for easier network provisioning, configuration, and management in the cloud.

The public network interfaces:  
    as the name suggests, connect the servers to the public internet,

the private : ones provide connectivity to your other cloud resources .

------------------------------------

setting up Security Groups and Access Control Lists (or ACLs). For further security and isolation of your resources in the cloud, 
most Cloud providers

provide 
1- Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), 
2- Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)
3- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

Some of the traditional hardware appliances such as 

firewalls,
load balancers
gateways
traffic analyzers 

can also be virtualized and made available as services in the cloud.

Another networking capability provided by the Cloud Providers is 
Content Delivery Networks or CDNs:
that distribute content to multiple points throughout the world so users accessing the content can access it more quickly 
by getting it from a point nearest to them.

Module 4 vid2 Virtualization and Virtual Machines Explained (5:21)

- virtualization:
    is the process of creating a software based, or virtual, version of something, 
    whether that be 
        compute, 
        storage, 
        networking, 
        servers, 
        applications. 
    And what makes virtualization feasible, is something called the "hypervisor".
    

- hypervisor : is it's simply a piece of software that runs above the physical server, or host. 
            And there are a couple different types of hypervisors out there. 
            
 There are two main types of hypervisors : 

Type 1  "bare-metal hypervisors" :
is a hypervisor that is installed directly on top of the physical server. They're also called bare-metal hypervisors.

- most secure,
- lower the latency, 
- most in the market
ex:  VMware, ESXi, or Microsoft Hyper-v, or even open-source KVM.

Type 2 "Hosted Hypervisors":

- there is a layer of host OS that sits between the physical server and the hypervisor.

-less frequent. 
-They're mostly used for end-user virtualization.
-higher latency

ex: Oracle, VirtualBox, or VMware Workstation. 

 A VM  : 
 
  - is simply a software based computer. They're run like a physical computer.
  - They have an operating system and applications, and they're completely independent of one another.
  - you can run multiple of them on a hypervisor.
  - the hypervisor manages the resources that are allocated to these virtual environments from the physical server.
  - Because they're independent you can 
            - run different operating systems on different virtual machines.
            - extremely portable. You can move a virtual machine from one hypervisor to another hypervisor 
                on a completely different machine almost instantaneously, 
                which gives you a lot of flexibility & portability 

 Benefits of vertualization :
  1- Cost savings.
    When you think about this and the fact that you can run multiple virtual environments from one piece of infrastructure,
    means that you can drastically بشكل جذري reduce your physical infrastructure footprint.
     This is consolidation at its core. And the fact that you don't have 
        - to maintain nearly as many servers,
        - run as much electricity,
        - save on maintenance costs, 

    means that you save on your bottom line at the end of the day.
    
2- Would be agility and speed: 

 spinning up بدأ  a virtual machine 
       - is relatively easy and quick - 
            a lot more simple than provisioning an entire new environment for your developers 
        
       - if they say they want to spin up a new
        environment so that they can run a test scenario. Whatever it might be, virtualization makes that process a lot simpler and quicker. 
        
3- lowers your downtime:

- Let's say that this host goes out unexpectedly. 
    The fact that you can move virtual machines from one hypervisor to another,
    on a different physical server, means that you have a great backup plan in place
 
 -if this host goes down
    you can simply move your VMs very quickly to another hypervisor on a
    machine that is working. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Module 4 Vid 3: Types of Virtual Machines (5:05)     

Virtual Machines or VMs "Virtual Servers or Virtual Instances" :


- When you create a virtual server in the cloud,
    1- you specify the Region and Zone or Data Center you want the server to be provisioned in 
    2- the Operating System you want on it.
    3- You can choose between shared (that is, a multi-tenant) VMs
                             dedicated (that is a single-tenant) VMs.

    4- you can also choose between hourly or monthly billing
    5- you can select storage and networking options for the virtual server.


 types of VMs:

 1- Shared or Public Cloud VMs:
         - are provider-managed
         - multi-tenant deployments that can be provisioned on-demand with predefined sizes.
                Being multi-tenant means that the underlying physical server is virtualized and is shared across other "tenants or users".
        
        - To satisfy different workloads
             cloud providers offer predefined sizes and configurations ranging 
                from a single virtual core and a small amount of RAM 
                to multiple virtual cores and much larger amounts of RAM.

    For example: there can be configurations for 
                    Compute Intensive workloads,
                    Memory intensive workloads,
                    High Performance I/O.
        Rather than pick from only pre-defined sizes, some providers also offer "custom configurations"
                                                                         that allow users to define the number of cores and RAM and local storage characteristics.

    - Public VMs are usually priced by the "hour" (or in some cases even seconds) and configurations start as low as pennies per hour.

    -Some providers also let you get monthly VMs,
             which can result in some cost savings if you know you will run the VM for at least a month,
                 but if you decide to de-commision the VM in the middle of the month, you will still be charged for the full month.


2- Transient or Spot VMs :
        - take advantage of unused capacity in a cloud data center.
        - Cloud providers make this unused capacity available to users
             at a much lower cost than regular VMs of similar sizes.

        - Although the Transient VMs are available at a huge discount,
             the Cloud provider can choose to "de-provision" them at any time 
                and reclaim the resources for provisioning regular, higher-priced, VMs.


Because you run the risk of losing these VMs :

    -these VMs are great for "non-production" workloads such 
        as testing and developing applications.
    - They are also useful for - running stateless workloads,
                               - testing scalability, or running big data 
                               -  high performance computing (HPC) workloads at a low cost.


3- Reserved virtual server instances :

    - allow you to reserve capacity and guarantee resources for future deployments.
    - You reserve desired amount of virtual server capacity, 
                provision instances from that capacity when you need them
                 and choose a term,
                     such as 1 year or 3 years, for your reserved capacity.

    - You're guaranteed this capacity within the data center of your choice for the life of the contract term. هتفضل في نفس الداتا سنتر طول فتره العقد 
    - By committing to a longer term, you can also lower your costs compared to hourly or monthly instances.

    -This can be useful when you know you require at least a certain level of cloud capacity for a specific duration.
            And if you exceed your reserved capacity, 
            you can always choose to supplement your unplanned usage and capacity requirements with hourly or monthly VMs.
            Note : however that not all predefined VMs families or configurations may be available as reserved.

4- Dedicated hosts  : 

    - offer single-tenant isolation.
        -This means that only your VMs run on a given host so they can 
            make exclusive use of full capacity and resources of the underlying hardware.
            
    - When provisioning a dedicated host you to specify the data center and POD in which you want your host placed. 
            You then assign instances, or virtual machines, to a specific host.
    - This allows for maximum control over workload placement.
    - Dedicated hosts are typically used for meeting compliance and regulatory requirements or meet specific licensing terms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
module 4 Video 4 : Bare Metal Servers (4:04)
 
 - bare metal server : 
 
    is a single-tenant, 
        dedicated physical server.
        In other words, it's dedicated to a single customer.

    -"The cloud provider" actually takes the physical server and plugs it into a rack in a data center for customers.
    -"The cloud provider" manages the server up to the operating system (OS) 
        which means if anything goes wrong with the hardware or rack connection 
        they will fix or replace it and then reboot the server.
        
    -The customer is responsible for administering 
                                     managing everything else on the server. الحركه دي هتخلي في اوبراشين مانجمنت كتير علي الكستومر 

---------------------------------------------

-bare metal servers :
     1- preconfigured by the cloud provider to meet workload packages

or   2- they can be custom-configured as per customer specifications. 
        This includes the processors, RAM, hard drives, specialized components, and the OS. 
    
-Customers - can also install their own OS 
           - can install certain hypervisors that aren't available from the cloud provider
           - create their own virtual machines and farms. 
--------------------------------------------

- bare metal servers  : you can also add "GPUs"
         which are designed for accelerating scientific computation 
                                             data analytics
                                             rendering professional grade virtualized graphics.

------------------------------------------


-bare metal servers are "physical machines"
    - they take longer to provision than virtual servers.
    
    - Pre-configured builds of bare metal can take 20 to 40 minutes to provision
    - custom-builds can take around three or four hours,
    
     - these provisioning times can varyby Cloud provider.
-------------------------------------------

 -Bare Metal servers are "dedicated" for use by a single client at any given time,
    - they tend  تتجه to be more expensive than similarly sized Virtual Machines.
    - unlike virtual servers, not all cloud providers provide Bare Metal servers.

- Since bare metal servers are fully customizable
  -they can do what a customer wants in the most demanding environments.
  

- Bare metal servers are dedicated and intended for 
    - long term,
    - high performance use in
    - highly secure and isolated environments.
    - Clients have full access and control of bare metal servers because there’s "no hypervisor required".
    
     - This means that they can be scaled up and optimized for high availability as needed.
 
 - As there is no sharing underlying server hardware with other customers,
    Bare metal servers fulfil the demanding needs of 
        -  high-performance computing ("HPC") and
        -  data intense applications that require “minimal latency-related delays”. 
        -  big data analytics applications
        -  GPU-intensive solutions.

- Some workload examples that bare metal servers satisfy are 
ERP, CRM, AI, Deep Learning, and virtualization.

If you use any applications that require high degrees of security control or apps that you’ve typically run in an on-premises environment,
عايز حاجه تضمنلك السكيورتي كانك بتن علي سيرفراتك اللي ف الشركه يبقي هو ده الانسب ليك
 then a bare metal server is a good alternative in the cloud.

-When comparing bare metal servers to virtual servers, 
some of the most important considerations

Bare metal servers work best for: 
    - CPU and I/O intensive workloads,
    - excel with highest performance and security,
    - satisfy strict compliance requirements,
    - offer complete flexibility,
    - control and transparency but come with "added management and operational overhead"

virtual servers  : 
    - are rapidly provisioned, 
    - provide an elastic & scalable environment
    - low cost to use,
    - however since they share underlying hardware with other virtual servers, they can be limited in throughput and performance
